# Decentralized Small-Scale Textile Production Coordination

This project enables small-scale textile producers to coordinate their activities through a decentralized system of smart contracts. The platform connects fiber farmers, processors, equipment owners, and buyers to create a transparent and efficient textile supply chain.

## Core Smart Contracts

The system consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Producer Registration Contract**
    - Records details of fiber farmers and processors
    - Manages producer profiles, certifications, and specialties
    - Enables verification of producer identity and credentials

2. **Quality Verification Contract**
    - Validates characteristics of fibers and textiles
    - Implements testing standards and quality assurance protocols
    - Creates verifiable quality certificates for products

3. **Equipment Sharing Contract**
    - Manages access to processing machinery
    - Handles scheduling, maintenance tracking, and usage fees
    - Enables collaborative ownership and resource optimization

4. **Direct Market Contract**
    - Facilitates connections between producers and buyers/designers
    - Manages listings, transactions, and reputation systems
    - Supports custom orders and batch production coordination
